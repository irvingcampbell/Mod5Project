# Improving SNAP: The Nation's Anti-Hunger Program

Date: December 2019

Project Members: Irving Campbell and Anil Onal

SNAP (Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program) is the nation's anti-hunger program operated by the USDA and implemented locally. USDA states that there are 40 million people, nationwide, who are enrolled to the program. Moreover, there are 20 million more, who would be eligable, but are not enrolled.

Given this context, we aim to answer two questions:
1. Is SNAP reaching enough people?
2. What are the priority areas that can help improve SNAP's targeting?

### Responsibilities:
 - Define project scope and focus
 - Collect data
 - Formulate question(s)
 - Perform exploratory data analysis
 - Train different models
 - Tune hyperparameters
 - Test the model
 - Derive conclusions
 - Create Master Notebook
 - Create presentation
 - Lint/clean code file
